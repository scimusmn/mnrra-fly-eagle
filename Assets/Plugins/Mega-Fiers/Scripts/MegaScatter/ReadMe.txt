
MegaScatter
MegaScatter is a system that allows you to scatter multiple objects into regions defined by splines. You can ask the system to either scatter the selected objects inside splines, or scatter along splines. Each object can have a weight for how often it will appear as well as random factors for scaling, rotation etc. You can ask the system to either scatter the objects as new objects in the scene or combine the objects into single meshes for reduced draw calls and increased performance. There is also the option to have the objects be scattered at runtime this means you can greatly reduce the size of your game and reduce loading times.

Included with MegaScatter is a basic version of our spline system MegaShapes, this allows you to create and edit your rgion splines directly in Unity or make use of our exporters to import your created splines from 3DS Max or Maya. MegaShapes also allows you to turn splines into Meshes with various options such as filling the spline with a mesh or turning the spline into a tube mesh or even twisted tubes.

How to use:
From the game object menu goto the Create Other option then select the MegaScatter menu, from here you can choose which type of scatter object you would like to create, currently the options are:
Scatter Mesh - This will scatter selected objects inside the choosen splines combining the end result to a single mesh
Scatter Mesh Along - Same as Scatter Mesh but this time will scatter along a spline
Scatter Object - Same as Scatter Mesh but individual objects will be created in the scene instead of combined to a single mesh
Scatter Object Along - Same as above but objects will be scattered along the spline.

Once you have created your object you will need to pick the MegaShapes object in the scene that you wish to scatter your objects in or along. The shape can have multiple splines so for example if your games needed multiple areas of trees you can define a shape object with dozens of splines and the system will happily fill all those areas with your selected trees instead of having to create lots of Scatter Objects and select a spline for each.

When you have selected your shape you can start adding the GameObjects you want to scatter in that shape, it can be a single type of object or you can have as many different objects as you need, click the 'Add Mesh' button to add a new object to the scatter list. You will see the params for the object appear in the inspector

IDEA: compound areas, say area under trees, keep adding to over time for leaf build up
IDEA: overlay or decal in skid marks based on a track shape and direction curve, with a density curve - would allow build up over time
IDEA: if we use this for marbles, have it so we can add to the end so can build up over time
